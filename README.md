### About ME: 
I’m a B.A. (Hons) Economics graduate with a minor in Commerce from the University of Delhi, passionate about applying economic insights to the financial industry.
My academic foundation spans micro & macroeconomics, econometrics, corporate finance, and public finance, helping me understand markets and policy dynamics.
I’m skilled in Excel, SQL, and financial modeling.
Curious by nature, I love transforming data into actionable insights that drive smarter business and financial decisions. I’m particularly interested in roles across financial analysis, business intelligence, and risk management. Strong in analytical reasoning, quantitative thinking, and communication, I thrive in collaborative and high-performance environments.
Combining my economics training with a passion for finance, I aim to grow as a data-driven financial professional. As a state-level football player, I bring discipline, teamwork, and strategic thinking to every goal I pursue.
Balanced mindset from sports, precision from economics, and drive from curiosity.
